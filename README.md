This project is in an experimental state, but it compiles and there are alpha releases out but the unit tests fail intermittently.
I would appreciate any feedback/help if it's useful.

Documentation is coming...

I am attempting to derive [Argonaut](https://github.com/argonaut-io/argonaut) codecs
using [Magnolia](https://github.com/propensive/magnolia). The functionality would be very similar to
[ArgonautShapeless](https://github.com/alexarchambault/argonaut-shapeless) but hopefully with the
compile time benefits that magnolia provides over shapeless.

There is a little more functionality in the hinted derivation which I shall document once
the code is properly tested
