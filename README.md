# Argonaut Magnolia #

Welcome to argonaut-magnolia!

This project is a WORK IN PROGRESS, it currently doesn't compile and has no tests

I am attempting to derive [Argonaut]() type classes namely, encoders and decoders using
[Magnolia](). The functionality would be very similar to [ArgonautShapeless]() but hopefully
with the compile time benefits that magnolia provides over shapeless.

There is a little more functionality in the hinted derivation which I shall document once
the code compiles.... Again this DOES NOT COMPILE YET...
